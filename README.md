#Endware BSD

Endware BSD is a port of the endware suite to BSD systems, tested
on OpenBSD 6.0 on a DEC/HP AlphaServer DS15, and on a Sun Microsystems 
SunBlade 2500.  Modifications are made so that a default installation of 
OpenBSD, with ports downloaded from the ports tree using pkg_add will be 
fully functional with this system.  More products exclusive to OpenBSD 
will emerge as time progresses.
